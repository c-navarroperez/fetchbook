# fetchbook

## Short description

The objective of this project is to create a website that can be used to search for books by using third party apis to retrieve book info. By default the New York Times best sellers will be available to be selected from a drop down, this is so the user can see the best seller books information. After searching for a book certain info will be printed to the UI in a card format. Each time an item is searched for and results are returned the search input will be saved to local storage and displayed in a search history section.

The app will be responsive and work on multiple devices
